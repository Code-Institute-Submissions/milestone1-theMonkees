I want to make a website that has the 60s feel of the band while still being a modern-style site. In my first attempt I was trying to be original but it ended up being quite 'oldschool' as my mentor put it, one of the main culprits was using scrollable div's as main text bodies. After thinking it through  I decides to go back to square one and completely redesign. The old site is still on github at:

With the new setup in mind I wanted to have the bright colors as I had them before, based off of the main picture on the landing page. Using an eyedropper I combined the colors of the image with a color calculator to get the right contrast with the background blue color I picked ('#c8e3ee'). The color calculator is at https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/

For the nav menu I used the colour of the logo that has been added as the brand. This ensured that the navbar really stood out.
